## Model Architecture

The model is a Sequential CNN with the following layers:
- Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3, ReLU) + MaxPooling2D
- Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3, ReLU) + MaxPooling2D
- Conv2D (128 filters, 3x3, ReLU) + MaxPooling2D
- Flatten
- Dense (128, ReLU) + Dropout (0.5)
- Dense (4 classes, softmax)

Compiled with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
